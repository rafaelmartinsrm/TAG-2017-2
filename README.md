# TAG-2017-2
Graph of students

This code is an application of the Bron Kerbosch algorithm in C++ for a particular case given by a note at the Graph Theory and Application course @ University of Brasilia.

This code was done in a week and can be improved in so many ways, by implementing BK2 or BK3 using pivots and by removing unnecessary code like changing the "vector v" to a "pointer v".

# Compile
g++ -std=c++11 -o Graph.o Graph.cpp Student.cpp

# Run
./Graph.o
